                <h5 className='py-4'>The Khajuraho Group of Monuments are a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres southeast of Jhansi. They are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and a few erotic sculptures.

                <h5 className="py-4">When these monuments were built, the boys in the place lived in hermitages, by being brahmcharis (bachelor) until they attained manhood and these sculptures helped them to learn about the worldly role of 'householder'.
                    The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region.</h5>
                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <h5 className='py-4'>The Khajuraho group of monuments was built during the rule of the Chandela dynasty.
                    The building activity started almost immediately after the rise of their power, throughout their kingdom to be later known as Bundelkhand.
                    Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga.
                    Yashovarman's legacy is best exhibited by the Lakshmana Temple. Vishvanatha temple best highlights King Dhanga's reign.â€Š The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King Vidyadhara. The temple inscriptions suggest many of the currently surviving temples were completed between 970 and 1030 AD, with further temples completed during the following decades.

                <h5 className="py-4">The Khajuraho temples were built about 35 miles from the medieval city of Mahoba,[15] the capital of the Chandela dynasty, in the Kalinjar region. In ancient and medieval literature, their kingdom has been referred to as Jijhoti, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-to, and Jejakabhukti.</h5>
